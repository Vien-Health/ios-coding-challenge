# Vien Health IOS Coding Challenge

## 	Tasks
The code is a small Swift project, with some third party dependencies managed by Cocoapods, that gets information about countries of the world from here: *restcountries-v1.p.rapidapi.com*

The first task is to get the project to build. You should not need to make changed to the source code to achieve this.

Once it builds run the UI tests, and note that they fail. Your task is to get the tests to pass **without** modifying the tests themselves. In other words there are bugs for you to fix. This is where you may need to edit source code.

The app displays a list of countries along with their capital and population. Add fields 'Region' and 'Area' to the UI and populate them with data from the API end point using 'region' and 'area' from the server response.


## What we are looking for
Please don't spend more than 3 hours on the test, we understand that your time is important.

* Clear, easy to read, self-documenting code.
* Clear, concise, and easy to read unit tests.
* Consistency with existing code: Architecturally, semantically, and idiomatically, unless you believe there's a compelling reason to deviate. If so, please document it.
* Commit history: we should be able to follow how you approached the problem, what the iterations were, and how roughly long it took.
* Task completion.
